            The Lion King is an animated movie made by Disney in 1994. It was the most successful animated movie of the
            1990s. The movie is about a young lion prince who learns about his role as prince and in the circle of life.
            It
            is dedicated to Frank Wells. Wells was the president of The Walt Disney Company. He died shortly before the
            movie was released into theaters. The movie was the first full-length Disney movie with no human characters
            since Bambi. Most of the voice acting was done by well-known actors. This includes Matthew Broderick, Nathan
            Lane, James Earl Jones, Jeremy Irons, Whoopi Goldberg, Cheech Marin, Rowan Atkinson and Jonathan Taylor
            Thomas.
            The Lion King is a musical. The music for the songs was written by Elton John. The lyrics were written by
            Tim
            Rice. Computer animation was used a lot to make the movie. When the movie was released, it was the most
            successful movie worldwide. It was behind Forrest Gump as most successful in the United States that year.
            The
            movie was the most successful animated feature movie of all time until Finding Nemo. As of February 2022,
            the
            movie has earned with over 1 billion dollars worldwide.

        <h3>the story of the lion king</h3>

        <p class="p1">
            In the Pride Lands of Africa, a pride of lions rule over the kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa and Queen
            Sarabi's newborn son, Simba, is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the mandrill, the kingdom's
            shaman and advisor. Mufasa's younger brother, Scar, covets the throne.

            After Simba grows into a cub, Mufasa shows him the Pride Lands and explains the responsibilities of kingship
            and the "circle of life," which connects all living things. One day, Simba and his best friend Nala explore
            an elephant graveyard, where the two are chased by three spotted hyenas named Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed. Mufasa
            is alerted by his majordomo, the hornbill Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though disappointed with Simba for
            disobeying him and putting himself and Nala in danger, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings
            of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba. Scar, having
            planned the attack, visits the hyenas and convinces them to help him kill both Mufasa and Simba in exchange
            for hunting rights in the Pride Lands.

            Scar sets a trap for Simba and Mufasa, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of
            wildebeest into a stampede to trample him. Mufasa saves Simba but winds up hanging perilously from the
            gorge's edge; he begs for Scar's help, but Scar throws Mufasa back into the stampede to his death. Scar
            tricks Simba into believing that the event was his fault and tells him to leave the kingdom and never
            return. Once Simba flees, Scar orders the hyenas to kill Simba, who manages to escape. Unaware of Simba's
            survival, Scar tells the pride that the stampede killed both Mufasa and Simba and steps forward as the new
            king, allowing the hyenas into the Pride Lands.

            After he collapses in a desert, Simba is rescued by two outcasts, a meerkat and warthog named Timon and
            Pumbaa. Simba grows up with his two new friends in their oasis, living a carefree life under their motto
            "hakuna matata" ("no worries" in Swahili). Years later, an adult Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a
            hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. Simba and Nala fall in love, and she urges him to return home,
            telling him that the Pride Lands have become drought-stricken under Scar's reign. Still feeling guilty over
            Mufasa's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells Simba that Mufasa's spirit
            lives on in him. Simba is visited by the spirit of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take
            his place as king. After Rafiki advises him to learn from the past instead of running from it, Simba decides
            to return to the Pride Lands.

            Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar. Scar taunts Simba over
            his supposed role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to Simba that he
            is the one who killed Mufasa. Shattered by the revelation, an enraged Simba retaliates and forces Scar to
            reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. A battle breaks out, and Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the
            lionesses fend off the hyenas. Scar attempts to escape, but is cornered by Simba at a ledge near the top of
            Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and blames his actions on the hyenas; Simba spares Scar's life but, quoting
            what Scar told him long ago, orders Scar to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar refuses and attacks his
            nephew, but after a brief battle, Simba throws him off the ledge to the ground below. Scar survives the
            fall, but the hyenas, who overheard him betraying them, attack and eat him.

            With Scar and the hyenas gone, Simba takes his place as king and Nala becomes his queen. With the Pride
            Lands restored, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle
            of life.

        <h4>marketing</h4>
        <p class="p2">For The Lion King's first film trailer, Disney opted to feature a single scene, the entire opening
            sequence
            with the song "Circle of Life". Buena Vista Pictures Distribution president Dick Cook said the decision was
            made for such an approach because "we were all so taken by the beauty and majesty of this piece that we felt
            like it was probably one of the best four minutes of film that we've seen", and Don Hahn added that "Circle
            of Life" worked as a trailer as it "came off so strong, and so good, and ended with such a bang". The
            trailer was released in November 1993, accompanying The Three Musketeers (1993) and Sister Act 2: Back in
            the Habit (1993) in theaters; by then, only a third of The Lion King had been completed. Audience
            reaction was enthusiastic, causing Hahn to have some initial concerns as he became afraid of not living up
            to the expectations raised by the preview. Prior to the film's release, Disney did 11 test
            screenings.

            Upon release, The Lion King was accompanied by an extensive marketing campaign which included tie-ins with
            Burger King, Mattel, Kodak, Nestlé, and Payless ShoeSource, and various merchandise,accounting 186
            licensed products.In 1994, Disney earned approximately $1 billion with products based on the
            film,with $214 million for Lion King toys during Christmas 1994 alone.</p>

        <h5>casting</h5>

        <p class="p3">
            The voice actors were chosen for how they fit and could add to the characters; for instance, James Earl
            Jones was cast because the directors found his voice "powerful" and similar to a lion's roar. Jones
            remarked that during the years of production, Mufasa "became more and more of a dopey dad instead of [a]
            grand king".

            Nathan Lane auditioned for Zazu, and Ernie Sabella for one of the hyenas. Upon meeting at the recording
            studio, Lane and Sabella – who were starring together in a Broadway production of Guys and Dolls at the time
            – were asked to record together as hyenas. The directors laughed at their performance and decided to instead
            cast them as Timon and Pumbaa. For the hyenas, the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong,
            but while Cheech Marin agreed to voice Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. His role was changed into a
            female hyena, Shenzi, voiced by Whoopi Goldberg, who insisted on being in the film.The English double
            act Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer auditioned for roles as a pair of chipmunks; according to Mortimer, the
            producers were enthusiastic, but he and Reeves were uncomfortable with their corporate attitude and
            abandoned the film. Rowan Atkinson was initially uninterested in the studio's offer to voice Zazu, later
            explaining that "voice work is something I generally had never done and never liked [...] I'm a visual
            artist, if I'm anything, and it seemed to be a pointless thing to do". His friend and fellow Mr. Bean
            writer/actor Robin Driscoll convinced him to accept the role, and Atkinson retrospectively expressed that
            The Lion King became "a really, very special film".
